# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement

In the highly competitive telecom industry, customers can easily switch between service providers, leading to an average annual churn rate of **15-25%**. Since acquiring a new customer is **5-10 times more expensive** than retaining an existing one, reducing customer churn is crucial for telecom companies.

The goal of this project is to **predict which customers are at high risk of churn** by analyzing customer-level data from a leading telecom firm. By building predictive models, we aim to identify the main indicators of churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

## Customer Lifecycle Phases

1. **Good Phase**: The customer is satisfied and exhibits normal usage behavior.
2. **Action Phase**: The customer begins to experience issues or considers competitors, showing changes in behavior.
3. **Churn Phase**: The customer has decided to leave the service.

Our analysis focuses on detecting customers in the **action phase** to proactively implement retention strategies.

## Approach

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**:
   - Explored and cleaned the dataset.
   - Handled class imbalance (churn rate at **10.19%**).
   - Engineered features based on usage patterns, recharge behavior, and customer demographics.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Developed various machine learning models, including tree-based models (Random Forest, CatBoost) and regression models (Logistic Regression).
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using metrics like **accuracy**, **recall**, **precision**, and **ROC-AUC score**.
   - Prioritized **recall for churners** to ensure that most potential churners are correctly identified.

## Best Model: Random Forest Classifier

### Why It's the Best

The **Random Forest classifier** emerged as the best-performing model for predicting customer churn:

- **Highest Churner Recall**: Achieved a recall of **76%**, correctly identifying the majority of customers likely to churn.
- **Balanced Performance**: Maintained an overall accuracy of **81%**, offering a good balance between detecting churners and correctly classifying non-churners.
- **Strong ROC-AUC Score**: Scored **0.8517**, indicating good discriminative ability between churners and non-churners.
- **Interpretability**: Allows for easier interpretation of feature importance, aiding in actionable business decisions.

By prioritizing churner recall, this model aligns with the business objective of minimizing customer attrition through proactive engagement and targeted interventions.

## Key Findings

### Important Features Influencing Churn

1. **Zero Call Usage**:
   - Churn rate of **72.4%** among customers with zero call usage.
   - Indicates significant disengagement from voice services.

2. **Declining ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**:
   - Customers with **ARPU â‰¤ 100** have a **24.5%** churn rate.
   - A declining ARPU pattern shows a **18.82%** churn rate.

3. **Recharge Frequency and Amount**:
   - **46.3%** of churners had significant recharge drops (>50% decrease).
   - Low recharge frequency correlates with a **23.2%** churn rate.

4. **Tenure**:
   - Customers with tenure **less than 6 months** have the highest churn rate at **22.9%**.
   - Emphasizes the need for early engagement with new customers.

5. **Usage Patterns**:
   - **Voice Usage**: Outgoing calls below 38.7 minutes lead to a **30.7%** churn rate.
   - **Data Usage**: Significant declines in 2G and 3G usage among churners.

6. **High-Value Customers**:
   - Lower churn rate of **5.6%** compared to **11.5%** for regular customers.
   - Highlighting the importance of retaining high-value segments.
